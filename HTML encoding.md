 how do we format the text from data to get the proper characters?
* We are seeing `HTML entites`, which is a way of replacing a character in
* HTML so it doesn't get mixed up with HTML syntax
* we can use free formatter and googling "unescaping HTML entities in python"
* we can also use the html module
* use html.unescape()
