# OVERVIEW

The app launches a Tk window. When the user clicks "Start," a 25 minute timer
begins. The timer can be paused by clicking the "Pause" button. While paused,
clicking "Pause" again will resume the timer. Clicking "Restart" while the 
timer is running, or while paused, will reset the program to its default state.

After every completed "work" timer, a ðŸ’¯ appears beneath the potato so the user
can keep track of their progress.

Once restarted, the user must click "Start" again to begin the pomodoro cycle
anew.

## Known issues:
* The window is supposed to pop to the top of the screen every time a timer
reaches 00:00. This is currently broken.


# LESSON NOTES
# the pomodoro technique 
    ## francesco 

1. figure out the task
2. set a time for 25 minutes
3. work for 25 minutes
4. 5 minute break
5. after 4 loops, take a 15 minute 

25 min work => 5 min break => 25 min work => 5 min break => 25 min work =>
5 min break => 25 min work => 20 min break

#insert image and overlay text
* tkinter.Canvas()
* allows for layering
* create_image() method
  * require x and y position
  * image parameter expects photoimage from tk.PhotoImage() class
  * canvas has its own bg that sits on top of the window
* use the fg= parameter to give widgets text a different color from the background
* bg for widget background
* the after() method can be used on a window object to call a function after a given interval
  * use after_cancel(widget) to suspend scheduling
* canvas.itemconfig(item_to_alter, **kwarg to alter)
